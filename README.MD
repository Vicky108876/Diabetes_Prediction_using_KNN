🩺 Diabetes Prediction Using KNN

This project is a machine learning web application that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It features a clean, user-friendly frontend and a Python-Flask backend, and uses a trained model with standardized inputs for accurate prediction.

Features
✅ Predict diabetes based on 8 medical parameters
✅ Trained using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
✅ Model and scaler saved using pickle
✅ Frontend with HTML form (no JavaScript)
✅ Backend using Flask framework
✅ Input data is standardized for better accuracy
